# dummy-controller
Demo Dummy-controller project built with Operator SDK v1.33.0 (using Golang v1.21)

## Description
Controller reconciles `apiVersion: homework.interview.me/v1alpha1` resources of
`kind: Dummy`, for each `Dummy` resource:
- controller updates `status.specEcho` with value from `spec.message`;
- ensures existance of bound `Pod` object, setting proper `OwnerReference`;
- updates `status.podStatus` with data from `Pod` `status.phase`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21+
- docker version 24.0.0+.
- kubectl version v1.19.2+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.19.2+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**
